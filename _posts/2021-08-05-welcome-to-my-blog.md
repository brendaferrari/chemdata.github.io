**Hello!**

**and welcome!**


In this blog I'm going to share with the internet my bio/cheminformatics learning process. I am going to write about the codes I have written and share new references I find along the way. 

I am learning python actively since december 2020 and my background is chemistry so I usually apply my codes written in python on chemistry based problems, mostly in drug development.

I had the idea to write a blog because when I needed the most, I got help in my struggles at blogs written by other generous souls. I hope I can help as many people as I can with the work I have already done.
